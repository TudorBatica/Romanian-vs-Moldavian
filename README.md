# Discriminate between the Romanian and Moldavian dialects 
In this repository you can find my 2 best performing ML models that I have used for this [Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ml-2020-unibuc-3 "Competition's page").  
The competition involved discriminating between the Romanian and Moldavian dialects on tweets. The tweets had been encrypted to prevent cheating.  
My best model - the SVC(which you can find in this repo) - had an <b>F-Score of 0.72436, ranking 25th out of 190.</b>
